Features:
This software runs much better if on WinXP.
It has been desgned with the visual styles, alpha and feel in mind.

I have not included the server code this time, but I may do if i get enought feedback.
Please send feedback, its the only way people like us get anywhere.

The app is very easy to use so you shouldn't screw it up.

The project has been lightly commented just to give a little insight into what is going on.
